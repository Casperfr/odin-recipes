            <li>Mix pork, shallots, fish sauce, oyster sauce, and soy sauce together in a large bowl.<br> Let mixture marinate in the refrigerator, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine self-rising flour, milk, and sugar in another large bowl; knead until dough is smooth and no longer sticky.<br> Cover dough with cheesecloth; let rest, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 18 balls.<br> Roll out each ball into a circle with a rolling pin on a floured work surface.<br> Place a spoonful of the pork mixture in the center; top with 2 sausage slices and an egg quarter.<br> Gather the edges of each circle together like a coin purse; twist and pinch to seal the bun.</li>
            <li>Cut waxed paper into eighteen 2-inch squares. Place each bun on a waxed paper square.<br> Arrange 1 inch apart in a steamer; cover with lid.</li>
